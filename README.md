# ymarker
Alternative tool to mark images for Darknet CNN

Thanks for your interest in this application.

yMarker was created using Pascal language over Linux Mint 20.1.
- Lazarus IDE version 2.0.6+dfsg-3
- FPC version 3.0.4

With yMarker, you can easily add, delete and resize bounding boxes in your tag files and you can directly edit your tag file (a small editor is placed at the bottom left corner of the application).
